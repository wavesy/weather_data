Webpage for inspecting TAMK weather station data.

Default page shows last 50 readings from all signals. Can be reached again by clicking on 'TAMK weather data' element in navbar.

Signal selection dropdown list is created dynamically by checking active signals from http://webapi19sa-1.course.tamk.cloud/v1/weather/names

From the navbar, user can select:
1. Signal
2. Timeframe
And the data / chart will be updated accordingly.
